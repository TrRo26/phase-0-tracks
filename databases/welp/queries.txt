2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. 

	welp :> sqlite3 welp.db 
	SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
	Enter ".help" for usage hints.

	sqlite> SELECT
   ...> users.id,
   ...> users.first_name AS First,
   ...> users.last_name AS Last,
   ...> reviews.stars AS Stars,
   ...> reviews.comment AS Comment,
   ...> businesses.name AS Name
   ...> FROM
   ...> users
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.id;

		1|Bradford|Pitt|4|Not too shabby!|The Beagle Nightclub
		2|Merryl|Streepman|3|Average|Plumbing by Janet
		3|Denzel|George|1|Just terrible!|Sushi World

3. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

	[This was the same as what I did above, but it seems to satisfy both questions]
	
	sqlite> SELECT
   ...> users.id,
   ...> users.first_name AS First,
   ...> users.last_name AS Last,
   ...> reviews.stars AS Stars,
   ...> reviews.comment AS Comment,
   ...> businesses.name AS Name
   ...> FROM
   ...> users
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.id;

		1|Bradford|Pitt|4|Not too shabby!|The Beagle Nightclub
		2|Merryl|Streepman|3|Average|Plumbing by Janet
		3|Denzel|George|1|Just terrible!|Sushi World

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

	sqlite> SELECT
   ...> users.id,
   ...> users.first_name AS First,
   ...> users.last_name AS Last,
   ...> reviews.stars AS Stars,
   ...> reviews.comment AS Comment,
   ...> businesses.name AS Name
   ...> FROM
   ...> users
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.id
   ...> WHERE businesses.id = 1;
