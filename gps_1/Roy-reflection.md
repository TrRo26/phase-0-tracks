#My Reflection

##Questions:

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
> *I think I was struggling most with the dynamic between git and github and utilizing the proper workflow at the proper time.*
* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
> *While I'm still working this out, I feel I have a much better understanding of how git and github work with each other. I also gained some insight into how partnering and sharing your work on github works.*
* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
> *I mainly asked my guide for clarification on the instructions and help with some basic syntax issues. My pair I asked for help with Markdown, as I had forgotten some of the language that we had previously learned.*
* **What still confuses you about Git?**
> *I'm still not completely clear on pushing and pulling from git to github. I understand the specific commands and the function of git and github, but I am still working on a clearer picture of how everything relates to each other (after merges, pushes, pulls, branching etc.)*
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
> *My experience was extremely positive. My guide was just the right amount of involved, and my pair and I worked really well together and seemed to be at roughly the same speed.*
