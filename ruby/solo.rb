# Design (as opposed to actually building) a class that has...
# 	- at least three attributes (using at least two data types) whose values will 
# 	  vary from instance to instance (example: age)
# 	- at least three methods, at least one of which takes an argument

# PSEUDOCODE

# Will be creating a BEER class with two attributes that vary from instance to 
# instance and will define three methods, one of which takes an argument.

# define a BEER class
	# define an INITIALIZE method with the following attributes:
		# => STYLE
		# => STATE_OF_ORIGIN
