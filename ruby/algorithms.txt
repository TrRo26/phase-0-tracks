Robot ---> Elevator Algorithm 

(making assumption that robot can see, is starting directly in front of and facing the elevator, and that no other robots or humans are using this same elevator)

- If elevator doors are closed:
	- Locate two vertically oriented buttons and press the top one 
	- When elevator doors open, move forward into center of elevator
- Otherwise:
	- Move forward into center of elevator
- If there are multiple buttons on the wall in front of you:
	- Press the button with "10" on it
- Otherwise:
	- Turn 90 degrees to the right, until multiple buttons are in front of you
	- Press the button with "10" on it
- If the elevator doors are in front of you
	- Wait until elevator doors open
- Otherwise:
	- Turn until facing elevator doors
	- Wait until elevator doors open
- Move forward until completely outside of elevator


Getting Out of Bed Algorithm
