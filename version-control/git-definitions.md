# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is the ability to save various instances of the same file or group of files at different points in time with the ability to revert back to any of those previously saved instances when desired. This is extremely useful should you mess something up, want to simultaniously make changes/work on a project at the same time as other people, need to review past changes or progress, want to take a project in multiple different directions, compare and select multiple different user updates as well as many other great reasons!  
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch starts off as a copy of an orinal file/project and allows the user to make changes and updates independently of the master file/project with an ability to merge these changes back with the master. Branching is useful as it allows a user to experiment with a file/project without exposing any other users who might simultaniously be working on (or just running) the same file/project to any of your "construction" mess. It also allows you to test any updates or changes prior to adding them to the master file/project. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is essentially a save. It is a version of a file/project at a specific point in time of your choosing that you are able to revert to. A good commit message clearly and specifically states what updates/changes have been made in the most succint manner possible.  
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is when different users (or I suppose it could be the same user depending on the circumstances) made edits to the same section or line of code/file/project and have attempted to merge them back to the master. The computer does not know which change to accept, and a merge conflict results.
