 # JQuery

### Instructions:

 Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

 > I will start by looking into several resources I noticed that were shared on Slack from the site teaching-materials.org. I will also look at previously used and trusted websites such as W3 Schools and other sites resulting from google searches.
 > I will not be setting pre-determined breaking points and will gauge these on how my researching transpires. I will stop and test when I feel I have learned enought to apply that concept as a whole. I will absolutely take several coffee/tea breaks when the timing feels right.
 > Aside from the above mentioned resources that I will be looking into, I plan to test out several basic uses of JQuery so that the overal application of JQuery becomes much clearer.
