**What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?**
	
	A GET request requests data from a specified resource and a POST request submits data to be processed to a specified resources. A GET request might be used when attempting to access a server for specific ingformation and a POST request might be used when the client is submitting information to a server (such as name, address, credit card #, etc.)


**Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?**

	Cookies are small text files that servers store on client systems that store information that is intended to streamline and tailor the next visit to that server/website. Cookies can be used to tailor advertising or simply streamline user experience among many other uses. When HTTP requests are made, cookies are created to identify the user accessing that particular server/website. This can ease stress on databases and help provide a more efficient user experience (and extremely annoying targeted advertising)
