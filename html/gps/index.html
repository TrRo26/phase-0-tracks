- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	HTML5 semantic tags are used to identify and label different areas of content that makes the overall collection of text/html more easily readable and arrangable. I would think the <section>, <header> and <footer> semantic tags would be most useful. <section> as it's an easy way to separate out different peices of content and <header> and <footer> as it not only accurately describes the type of information that would be contained within, but it also provides an indication of the top and bottom of a page.
- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	A browser reads html from top to bottom and from left to right, similar to (most) languages
- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned that you can create and edit snippets, which are wonderful. I can absolutely see myself creating numerous snippets in my future, however, I am going to resist the urge for as long as possible as the repetition involved with having to type things out might help the learning process.
- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The most difficult part of this challenge for me was understanding the appropriate use for specific semantic tags. I'm pretty sure I have a grasp on what they are used for and why they are used, but I'm still not entirely sure as to the appropriate types of content that should be used with each tag. I can imporve my understaning of this by doing a bit of research, then actually trying it out.
